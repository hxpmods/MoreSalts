# A Pinch Of Salt

 A Potion Craft mod that adds craftable elemental salts and more!
 
 **Salt designs are not final.**
 
## Installation:

This mod requires [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases). Look [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/unity_mono.html) for a guide on how to install it.

Once fully installed, simply extract all of the downloaded files into your **BepInEx/plugins** folder.

## Features:
* Custom salts with custom behaviours and Alchemy Machine recipes!
* A salt for each element, and a mystery salt with a more involved recipe.
* Code examples for how to add custom salts and recipes.

## Planned Features:

* Custom unlock triggers for salts.
* A salt merchant to buy and sell from.
* Salts with secondary abilities.
* Unique salts that modify the path in exciting ways.
* And many more!

## Known Issues:

* On the left hand side of the recipe book, custom salts will display as Moon Salt.
* Salt amount text is white and does not appear until the Salt has been used after dragging it out of the inventory.
* Some salts missing tool tips.

This project is early in development. Any help, by reporting any bugs or conflicts found whilst using this mod would be greatly appreciated.
